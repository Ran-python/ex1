# Ex1 – Basic Programming: Polynomials, Static Functions & JUnit
**Ariel University – School of Computer Science – 2026**  
**Introduction to Computer Science / Ex1 Assignment**

---

## 📌 Abstract
This assignment introduces basic programming concepts in Java, including:
- Static functions
- Working with arrays
- Numerical computation
- Recursion
- JUnit testing
- Git and version control

The main goal is to implement a set of static methods that operate on **polynomials**, represented as **1D arrays of doubles**, and to create **JUnit tests** to verify correctness. The assignment requires understanding of functional programming and numerical approximation techniques such as Riemann integration and curve length estimation.

## 📘 Polynomial Representation
A polynomial is represented as a double array where each element corresponds to a coefficient:

Example:
```java
double[] p = {0.1, 0, -3, 0.2};
